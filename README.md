## Store Background 
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer information, product categories, order times and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement 
The store does not have a clear idea about:
1. Which products sell the most
2. Customers' preference
3. Which items bring in the most profit, and
4. Where things are going wrong in delivery or operations.
Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, losing customers and making poor business decisions.

## Solution
They need proper reports and simple insights to understand their sales, customers, and product performances better.
